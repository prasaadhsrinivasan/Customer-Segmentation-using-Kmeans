# Predict Customer Churn using Random Forest Classification

Customer retention is one of the primary growth pillars for products with a returning customers and subscription models.

Customer churn (or customer attrition) is a tendency of customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a companyâ€™s products or services during a particular time period is called a customer churn (attrition) rate. 

Churn rate is a health indicator for businesses whose customers are subscribers and paying for services on a recurring basis


# Data Source and Preperation

Dataset is Telecommunication Churn from Kaggle Dataset 

The training dataset contains 4250 samples. Each sample contains 19 features and 1 boolean variable "churn" which indicates the class of the sample. The 19 input features and 1 target variable

In Data cleaning and preparation, We clean the dataset and we handle the categorical variables into machine learning format (Check the Jupyter notebook)

## Exploratory Data Analysis


## 1. No of Users per churn (If the churn number is 1 the customer has discontinued)

## 2. Number of Customer Service Calls made per churn

## 3. Churn Rate per state in the US

## 4. Total Daily calls and how it affects churn rate

## 5. Total Evening Calls and how it affects churn rate

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## 1. Check for missing values

Make there is no missing date using train.isnull().sum()

## 2. Deleting highly corelated variables

We check for highly corelated variables using corr() function and delete variables which are highly corelated with other variables

## 3. Handling Categorical Variables

We handle categorical features like area code using map function 

# Building a churn prediction model

## 1. Feature Scaling 

We use "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler" to normalize the all the values 

## 2. We split the dataset into train and test

## 3. Random Forest Regressor Model

We fit the model using from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor with random state 42 for reproducability

## 4. Fine Tune Model

We fine tune the model using GridSearchCV by using different parameters

## 5. Predict

We use predict function to find the accuracy of the model
